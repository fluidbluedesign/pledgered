			<p class="mediumText">Giving blood saves lives. The blood you give is a lifeline in an emergency and for patients who need long-term treatments.
				Many of these patients would not be alive today if donors had not generously given a small amount of their time to donate blood.

			<p class="mediumText">Pledge Red is an organisation that aims to encourage and increase the number of donations from both existing and new blood donors. We work to track the progress of our donors, letting them know the difference they make to many people’s lives every day. As a thank you for their generosity, we set up a rewards programme which seeks to encourage and promote blood donating across the country.</p>
